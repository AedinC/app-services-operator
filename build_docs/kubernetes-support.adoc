=== Manually installing CRDS

For rapid testing of RHOAS CLI we can use Operator CRDs in headles mode (without running controller).

----
minikube start
cd olm/olm-catalog/rhoas-operator/0.9.0/manifests 
kubectl apply -f .
----

=== Testing with running operator

Operator can be started to process all requests created by RHOAS CLI

----
mvn quarkus:dev -Dkubernetes.trust.certificates=true
